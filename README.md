# Asteroids

- This game was inspired by the 1979 Atari origional asteroids game. The goal of the game is to safely navegate your craft through the outer rims of the solar system, surviving as long as possible in the dangeroous asteroid belt.

- Use the directional arrow keys to navigate your space craft and press the space bar to fire your cannons.

- There are five different types of ships, each handles differently and has different advantages.

- Pressing 'c' turns your ship into a moon lander, which is more effective at evading asteroids. Pressing 'c' again as a moon lander makes the lander flash red, and then lay a mine which lasts 1000 frames. The moon lander drops rounds straight down as apposed to directionaly.
	
- Pressing 'v' turns your ship into a spacer, which is faster than the moon lander. Pressing 'v' again as a spacer allows the user to teleport to a safe location. If teleportation fails, the spacer will flash red. If teleportation is sucessful, the spacer flashes blue. Holding the down arrow key as a spacer activates the turbo booster, which accelerates the spacer 3X normal speed. The spacer shoots normal rounds directionaly.

- Pressing 'b' turns your ship into a sniper, which moves and handles more sluggishly than the normal spacer. Pressing 'b' again as a sniper activates the scope, which makes it easier to target distant asteroids. Holding the down arrow key as a sniper auto targets the closest asteroid withing a 300 pixel radius, making it easier to destroy. As an important side note, the auto target also takes into account the trajectory and distance of the asteroid it is targeting, and targets accordingly. The sniper fires more powerful lasers which cut through asteroids without dying and travel much faster and further than normal rounds

- Pressing 'n' turns your ship into a gunner, which has a quicker rotation speed than the normal spacer. Holding the down arrow key as a gunner activates the airbreaks, which bring the craft to a halt, which can be very usefull. Holding down the space bar as a gunner fires a continuous stream of regular bullets, which travel shorter distances. (Hint - float towards a group of asteroids holding down one of the side arrow keys and the space bar for hours of fun)
	
- Pressing 'm' turns your ship into the feeble ship. The feeble ship is smaller, slower and less agile than other ships. The feeble ship fires weak bullets that travel short distances.

- Pressing 'x' inverts controlls
